# Input Validation in Flutter

## Project Overview
This project is a multi-form Flutter application designed to validate user inputs across at least two screens. It implements robust input validation for fields such as Name, Email, and Phone Number while ensuring a smooth navigation experience.

## Project Features
- **Input Validation:** The application consists of two separate screens with various input fields.
- **Validator:**
  - **Name:** Ensures the field is not empty.
  - **Email:** Validates the format using a regex pattern.
  - **Phone Number:** Checks if the input consists of valid digits and a suitable length.
- **Error Messages:** Clear error messages are displayed when invalid input is provided.
- **Navigation:** Users can navigate between screens seamlessly.
- **Structured Code:**
  - `main.dart` contains only the `void main()` method, `runApp()`, and core logic.
  - Screens are implemented in separate files for maintainability.
- **User Interface:** Though aesthetics were not a primary requirement, the UI is clean and user-friendly.
